# About this Repo

This is the Git repo of the official SonarSource Helm Chart for SonarQube.  
The actual Chart can be found in the [charts](charts/) directory, with further explaination.

Have Question or Feedback?
--------------------------

For support questions ("How do I?", "I got this error, why?", ...), please first read the [documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org) and then head to the [SonarSource forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/). There are chances that a question similar to yours has already been answered. 

Be aware that this forum is a community, so the standard pleasantries ("Hi", "Thanks", ...) are expected. And if you don't get an answer to your thread, you should sit on your hands for at least three days before bumping it. Operators are not standing by. :-)

Contributing
------------

If you would like to see a new feature, please create a new thread in the forum ["Suggest new features"](https://community.sonarsource.com/c/suggestions/features).

With that in mind, if you would like to submit a code contribution, please create a pull request for this repository. Please explain your motives to contribute this change: what problem you are trying to fix, what improvement you are trying to make.

Note of Thanks
--------------

The work on this chart was kickstarted by the great people who contributed to the Oteemo charts.  
SonarSource would like to thank everyone for their contribution and great work they did over the last years of unofficially maintaining a easy way of consuming SonarQube on Kubernetes.
